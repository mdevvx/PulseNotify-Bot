"""Twitch Helix API adapter — live/offline detection (Phase 5).

API research (2026-09-15), verified against Twitch's current developer
documentation, not scraped/undocumented endpoints — see
[[project-platform-api-policy]] / README.md for the standing policy this
follows:

| Feature             | Method                        | Auth              | Notes |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Live/offline         | GET /helix/streams?user_id=   | app access token  | No broadcaster authorization needed — this event requires no scope. Batches up to 100 IDs/call, but (like the YouTube adapter) this one polls one account at a time to match the framework's per-account worker model; Twitch's 800-points/minute app-token budget makes cross-account batching unnecessary at this bot's scale. |
| Channel resolution   | GET /helix/users?login=       | app access token  | Resolves a login/URL to a stable numeric user ID, stored as platform_account_id — a login can be renamed, the ID can't. |

Considered and explicitly ruled out (2026-09-15, user sign-off) — see
README's Monitoring framework section for the full writeup:
- **EventSub WebSocket transport** — needs a *user* access token capped at
  a total subscription cost of 10 per (client_id, user) tuple. Not viable
  for monitoring arbitrary streamers who haven't authorized this app.
- **EventSub webhooks** — the "correct" push-based approach (instant
  alerts, a 10,000 cost ceiling per client_id), but requires standing up a
  public HTTPS callback endpoint (valid TLS, port 443) this project
  doesn't have yet. Deferred until that infrastructure exists — polling is
  cheap enough here (unlike YouTube's live-search quota crisis) that
  there's no cost pressure forcing the issue.

Credentials: TWITCH_CLIENT_ID/TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET, an app access token via
the OAuth client-credentials flow — no per-broadcaster authorization.

No adapter-level quota budgeting is needed here, unlike YouTube: Twitch's
app-token bucket is 800 points/minute and this adapter spends 1 point per
account per poll — the framework's own generic per-platform RateLimiter
(MONITORING_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS/_PERIOD_SECONDS, default 30/60s) is
already far more conservative than that budget.

VOD/clip publishing and channel title/category updates while already live
(STREAM_UPDATED) aren't implemented this phase — Twitch's core value here
is live-alerting, matching what the phase was scoped for.
