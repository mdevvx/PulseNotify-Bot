"""The normalized event model every platform adapter produces (section 27).

Adapters never see or set `guild_id`/`account_id` — those are our internal
database identifiers, and a given piece of platform content is normalized
once per adapter call but may end up attached to a specific guild's
monitoring only after the fact. `PlatformAdapter.normalize_event()` returns
an event with both left as None; `monitoring.worker.AccountWorker` (which
*does* know which guild/account it's polling for) fills them in via
`dataclasses.replace()` before the event goes anywhere near the database.

The EventType values here must stay in sync with the `event_type_t`
Postgres domain in database/migrations/0002_core_schema.sql — this is the
Python-side single source of truth; that migration is the database-side one.
