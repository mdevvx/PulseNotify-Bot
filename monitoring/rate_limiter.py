"""A sliding-window async rate limiter, shared by every worker polling the
same platform (section 24: RateLimitManager).

One instance per platform, owned by that platform's PlatformScheduler —
the limit is against the platform's API as a whole, not per-account, so
all of that platform's workers must acquire from the same instance.

Some APIs (YouTube Data API v3 in particular: search.list costs 100 quota
units, playlistItems.list costs 1) charge different amounts for different
calls against the same shared budget. `acquire`/`try_acquire` take an
optional `cost` for that — the default of 1 makes an uncosted call behave
exactly as a plain "N requests per period" limiter, so existing callers are
unaffected.
